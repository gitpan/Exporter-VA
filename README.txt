This is Exporter::VA - Improved Exporter featuring Versioning and Aliasing.

The documentation is in the module's POD. 
More information about the module can be found on its home page, < http://jmd.perlmonk.org/Exporter-VA >.
The latest version can be found there, or on CPAN under < http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DL/DLUGOSZ/ >.

Installing is trivial -- just copy the .pm file to the Perl library tree.  The install.perl program does this, and runs
the unit/regression tests.

The author hangs out on < http://www.perlmonks.org >, and entertains discussion or questions about the module
there.

Included is the utility Exporter::VA::Convert.perl which will generate Exporter::VA statements from the
equivilent classic Exporter usage.  See it's own POD for details.
