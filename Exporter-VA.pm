=head1 SYNOPSIS

In module ModuleName.pm:

	package ModuleName;
	use Exporter::VA qw/import AUTOLOAD VERSION/;

	our %EXPORT= ( # all configuration done in this one hash
		foo => [ v1.0, 'foo_old', v2.0, 'foo_new' ],
		bar => 'bar_internal',
		baz => 'baz',
		fobble => \&figure_it_out, # parameter list is (caller, version, symbol, param-list tail)
		bobble => \\&_boble_internal,
		'$x' => '$x',
		'$y' => \\$y,  # a hard reference rather than a name
		':tagname' => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],
		':DEFAULT' => [ v1.0, ':_old_imports', v2.3, ':_new_imports' ],
		':_old_imports' => [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'fobble' ],
		':_new_imports' => [ 'fobble' ],
		'.option' => "value",
		'.default_VERSION' => v1.5,
		'.warnings' => 1
	);

In other files which wish to use ModuleName:

	use ModuleName;

	use ModuleName v2.1;

	use ModuleName v2.1 qw/ foo bar fobble $y/;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This main incentive in creating this exporter is to allow modules to be updated and
get rid of default exports in newer releases, while still maintaining compatibility with
older code.

=head2 What it Gives the Client's 'use' Statement

If ModuleName gets its C<import> function via C<Exporter::VA>, then the client that
C<use>s ModuleName will generally see these features:

	use ModuleName v2.3.4 qw( foo &bar $x -verbose :constants );

=over 4

=item names

List the names of the things you want imported.  Functions may omit the C<&> character.
You can import C<&functions>, C<$scalars>, C<%hashes>, C<@arrays>, and even
C<< <FILES> >>.

=item tags

A group of things may be named with a tag, beginning with a C<:> character.  Naming this
will expand into the group it represents.

=item pragmas

An item may be listed which has some effect on the import process but doesn't actually import a
symbol by that name.  Ideally, these begin with a leading C<-> (dash) character, but any symbol can
actually be a pragma.  Pragmas can take arguments.

Different clients of a module can have different options in effect which influence the behavior of
the module, and the module can, with the help of C<Exporter::VA>, keep track of which client
has which settings and react accordingly.  For example, some clients may activate C<-verbose>
mode, and others leave it off.

Those that begin with a double-dash are handled by the C<Exporter::VA> module itself, and
are not defined by the module you are C<use>-ing.  So, their meaning and availability will
be the same on any module that is built with C<Exporter::VA>.

These are C<--verbose_import>, which will detail the import process
for purposes of troubleshooting; and C<--dump> which will print the state of the
C<%EXPORT> definition and internal state.

=back

I said it will I<generally> have these features because C<Exporter::VA> is very customizable.
Modules with unique needs that had their own exporter code can hopefully "upgrade" to C<Exporter::VA>
and get it to work like it did before, gaining the versioning ability.

A future version may support patterns as seen in the classic C<Exporter> module.  Specifically, a
parameter beginning with C<!> or C</> would be handled internally, as would parameters that
are qr's rather than strings.

Parameters beginning with C<+> will never be used specially by C<Exporter::VA>, so if you
want to add a feature that uses a different prefix symbol, this is a good one to use.

=head2 Module Versioning

The syntax of the C<use> statement allows for a version number as an
indirect object (that is, no comma follows it).  A module may export different things
depending on the requested version.  Tags may expand into different lists based on
version.  Specifically (and this was the original motivation for writing this), the C<:DEFAULT>
tag (equivilent to the C<@EXPORT> list in the classic Exporter module) may
contain different things based on version.

=head2 How to Incorporate

The module that wishes to draw upon C<Exporter::VA> for its export needs can simply import
the C<import> and C<VERSION> functions.  Note that this is different from the classic Exporter
module in that it needs C<use> instead of C<require>, and does not inherit from it.

You can import the C<import> function and C<Exporter::VA> will provide you with one.  If you
prefer, you can write C<import> yourself to do some enhancements, and then from it call one
of the helper functions.

You can also import the C<AUTOLOAD> function, which is an easy way to lazy-generate any
aliased functions that are called via module-qualified syntax.  There are other ways to do this,
described later.

All information for configuring the module's use of C<Exporter::VA> is given in a single hash.
By default, this will be the C<%EXPORT> hash found in the calling package.

Or, you can include a hashref as a parameter to the C<use>, and this will specify the
destination.

	my %Export= ( #...
	use Exporter::VA (\%Export, ':normal');  # look ma, no package globals!

	use Exporter::VA ('import', {
		foo => \\&internal_foo,
		bar => \\&internal_bar
		} );  # put it all inline in this statement.

However it's found, this document will call this information the C<%EXPORT> definition.

=head2 Keys in the %EXPORT definition

There are several kinds of keys that may be present in the C<%EXPORT> definition, and
they have different purposes and different usage rules.

=over 4

=item symbols

If the hash key begins with a Perl sigil, left-angle (a pseudo-sigel for file handles) or a Perl 
identifier character (to be exact, C<< /^[$@%*&\w<] >>)
it names a symbol that the module's user may import by that name.  If there is no sigil, then it
assumes a C<&>, so you can say C<foo> instead of C<&foo>.

=item tags

If the hash key begins with a C<:> character, then it names a list of other names.  The module's user
may use this tag to import the whole list, as with the traditional C<Exporter> module.

=item pragmas

If the hash key begins with a C<-> (dash) character, then the module user may "import" it to trigger
code or special features of the module.

=item options

If the hash key begins with a C<.> (dot) character, it has special meaning to C<Exporter::VA> and is
used as an option or parameter to configure the module's use of the exporter.

=back

=head2 symbols

If the hash key begins with a Perl sigil or a Perl identifier character (to be exact, C<< /^[$@%*&\w<] >>)
it names a symbol that the module's user may import by that name. 

The value may be a name, a hard link, a callback, or a version list.

=over 4

=item name

If the value is a scalar, then it is the name of the symbol within the package to export.  This
does not have to be the same as the export name that the module's user will see.

	%EXPORT= (
		'&foo' => "foo",  # & is optional for functions
		'$bar' => '$_internal_bar',
		'baz' => ""  # means "same".
		);

As a special case, an empty string means that the internal name is the same as the
export name.  C<< foo => "foo" >> can also be specified as C<< foo => '' >>.  See also the L<.plain>
option.

A value of C<undef> means that the symbol is not available for import.  This is the same as not
listing it at all for a simple name value, but is useful as part of a version list, to indicate that the function
was dropped at some point.

This name is matched against the defining package's symbol table.  It does not handle inheritence or
fancier things.  If you need that, use a hard link or callback instead.  There is no plan to support
inherited methods, since (virtual) methods are commonly not exported anyway and it is trivial to
work-around for the desired effect without bothering the module's client.

=item non-scalars

If the value is not a scalar or C<undef>, than it is a reference of some kind.  This module distinguishes several
types based on the kind of reference: array ref is a version list, code ref is a callback, scalar ref is a hard link.
Others are errors.

=item version list

If the value is an array reference, then it specifies alternating v-strings and symbol values.

	foo => [ v1.0, 'foo_old', v2.0, 'foo_new' ]

It must begin with a v-string that is the oldest supported version.  That is followed by the value to use for
that version and later, until it changed with the next named version, and so on.  The last value is "current"
and used up to and including this module's stated C<$VERSION>.

So, in the above example, if the module's user called for:

	use ModuleName v1.78 ('foo');  # note no comma after v-string

then C<ModuleName> will export its C<foo_old> function as the caller's C<foo>.

The values in this list in the even positions are the same kinds of values used for
symbol name entries, except for another version list.  It may be a name, hard link, callback, or C<undef>.

=item callbacks

If the value is a code reference, then it specifies a callback function.  This code will be called
when the symbol is being imported, and can do something more complex than the version list
allows.

	%EXPORT= (
		'&foo' => \&figure_it_out_later,
		'$bar' => sub { ... logic goes here ... },
		'%fible' => sub { \%internal_fible }
		);

When that line is triggered at import time, the code is called with the following parameters:

	sub figure_it_out_later
	 {
	 my ($blessed_export_def, $caller, $version, $symbol, $param_list_tail)= @_;

The C<$caller> is the package name of the module's user; that is, the one doing
the importing.  C<$version> is the v-string of the version he's asking for.  C<$symbol>
is the name of the symbol he's asking for (a function name will have the C<&> added).
Finally, the last argument is an array ref of the rest of the parameter list to C<import>, which
this callback may inspect or modify (see L<pragmas|pragmas>, below).

(More technically, the C<$param_list_tail> will contain the rest of the items in the tag definition
if triggered during a C<:TAG> import, or the rest of the "batch" if extension code triggers importing
of a list of items programmatically.)

To indicate success and that a symbol was found, function must return a reference to the proper 
type of thing, which is what will be placed in the caller's package.

To indicate success and that no symbol should be imported (that is, a pragmatic import) the function
returns C<undef>.  The intent is for pragmatic imports to begin with a dash, but for compatibility
with existing modules that may want to adopt C<Exporter::VA>, any symbol may silently "fail" to
import this way, without error.

To indicate an error, C<die> with an error string.

=item hard links

As explained above, if the C<%EXPORT> definition contains a text string like C<< '&foo' => "&foo" >>, then when triggered
it will symbolically reference C<&ModuleName::foo>.  Instead, you can specify a hard-link, and
not even have a name that is visible outside the package (or even the scope!).

In the section on L<callbacks|callbacks>, the callback C<< '%fible' => sub { \%internal_fible } >>
ignores the parameters and always returns a reference to the same thing.  This is exactly what is
meant by a hard-link here.  Only there is a shortcut for doing it:

	'%fible' => \\%internal_fible

Basically, use a double-reference to the desired symbol, and that will directly be used at export
time as opposed to finding it by name first.

Syntactically, this is a reference to a scalar which must itself contain a reference to the right
kind of thing.  It is sensible for the normal meaning of the backslash in Perl, adding another
layer of deferring things.

=back


=head3 tags

If the hash key in the C<%EXPORT> definition begins with a C<:> character, then it names a list of other names.
The module's user may use this tag to import the whole list, as with the traditional C<Exporter> module.

The value is a list ref.  It may either be a list of names, or a list of alternating v-strings and tags.

A list of names is simply that.  The contents of the list replace the tag's name in the C<import>
parameter list.  So, given

	%EXPORT= (
		apple => ...
		banana => ...
		pear => ...
		potato => ...
		cheeze => ...
		':fruit' => [ qw/apple banana pear/ ]
	);

Then the module's user might say

	use ModuleName v1.78 qw/potato :fruit cheeze/;

to mean the exact same thing as 

	use ModuleName v1.78 qw/potato apple banana pear cheeze/;

The other form is used to version a list.  The concept is the same as the L<version list|version list> used
for symbol values: The list alternates v-strings and other tag names.  The original tag is replaced by
the one that matches the desired version, and then processing continues.

For example, given

	%EXPORT= (
		':list' => [ v1.0, ':_old_list', v2.3, ':_new_list' ],
		':_old_list' => [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'fobble' ],
		':_new_new' => [ 'fobble' ]
	);

then 

	use ModuleName v1.2 ':list';

means the same thing as

	use ModuleName ':_old_list';

and

	use ModuleName v2.4 ':list';

means the same thing as

	use ModuleName ':_new_list';

(except that directly importing something that begins with an underscore gives a warning).

=head4 the :DEFAULT tag

If there is nothing specified in the import parameter list, then it behaves as if C<:DEFAULT> was
specified.  This is how you list what gets imported if you don't specify otherwise, and is the
equivilent of C<@EXPORT> in the traditional C<Exporter> module.

=head4 symbols and tags work together

If a package imports the default in this example, it will note that C<foo> was imported in versions 
before v2.3 but dropped as a default in that version. But, in version 2.0 the implementation changed, 
so it will pull in C<foo_old> if the requested version is less than 2, or C<foo_new> if between 2.0 and 2.3, or 
not import it at all if 2.3 or later.

	%EXPORT= (
		foo => [ v1.0, 'foo_old', v2.0, 'foo_new' ],
		':DEFAULT' => [ v1.0, ':_old_imports', v2.3, ':_new_imports' ],
		':_old_imports' => [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'fobble' ],
		':_new_imports' => [ 'fobble' ],
		# ... others ...

Looking at it step-by step, the module changed what was imported by default.  In the traditional
system, that's like changing C<@EXPORT> and moving them to C<@EXPORT_OK> instead.

Meanwhile, the implementation of C<foo> changed in version 2.0.  The decision of which version of
C<foo> to import is independant and orthogonal of the decision of whether C<foo> gets imported by default.

=head3 pragmas

If the hash key in the C<%EXPORT> definition begins with a C<-> (dash) character, then it defines a pragmatic
import.  Also, unlike other "symbol" names, since this is not going to define a Perl symbol, it is not
limited to legal identifier names.  Any character that does not otherwise cause problems may be used
in an option that begins with a dash.

This is used to trigger a callback, without actually importing anything.  For example, given

	%EXPORT= (
		'-prag' => \&callme,
		# ...

then the calling module can say:

	use ModuleName v1.0 qw/ foo -prag bar/;

and between doing the work of resolving C<foo> and resolving C<bar>, it will trigger the function C<&callme>.  
This is I<exactly> like a callback for a symbol, except that if the symbol name begins with a dash it is
thrown away after it resolves it, and doesn't put it into the calling module's package.  (Note that "resolving" here
means figuring out what to import and adding it to a L<worklist|worklist>.  It doesn't actually modify the caller's namespace until
later.)

Since a callback can see the rest of the import parameter list and modify it, a pragma can take
parameters by shifting them off the list.

A pragma might be used to customize the behavior of a module.  The module can remember the
settings associated with each importer by using a hash keyed by the caller (importer).

	%EXPORT= (
		'-strict' => sub { my $caller= shift; $strict{$caller}=1; }

=head3 options

If the hash key in the C<%EXPORT> definition begins with a C<.> (dot) character, it has special meaning 
to C<Exporter::VA> and is used as an option or parameter to configure the module's use of the exporter.

Those that begin with a C<&> symbol (after the initial dot) take code references that are invoked
just like export callbacks.

=over 4

=item .allowed_VERSIONS

The version asked for must be on this list.  Normally, version numbers are checked to see if they are
between version numbers where things changed, but the exact number doesn't matter.	If you specify
a list here, then only versions on this list are accepted.

		'.allowed_VERSIONS' => [
			v1.0, # initial relase
			v1.1, # minor fixes

=item .&begin

This is called just like a symbol callback, before proceeding with processing all the symbols
in the import list.  Any return value is ignored.


	%EXPORT= (
		'.&begin' => sub {
		  my ($blessed_export_def, $caller, $version, '.&begin', $param_list_tail)= @_;
		  #...


=item .check_user_option

		'.&check_user_option' => &checkfunction

This can be used to supply a checking function without having to derive a class.  It works exactly
like the C<L<check_user_option>> method.

If you have callbacks that respond to user-defined options, but did not have to derive a class
from C<Exporter::VA> to do what you needed, then use this to implement warning-checking on
those options.

=item .default_VERSION

If the module importer does not specify a version in its C<use> statement, then this value is used.
Typically, when switching from C<Exporter> to C<Exporter::VA> to facilitate reducing the list of
things exported by default, or versioning a symbol, set the C<.default_VERSION> to the last version
before the change.  Then, any code that doesn't specify otherwise will get the backward-compatible imports.

		'.default_VERSION' => v1.99,  # changed stuff with 2.0, must ask for new stuff.

If not specified, then a v-string is required in the C<use> statement.

=item .&end

Just like C<.&begin>, but called after the C<import> list has been all processed, and the symbol parameter
of course is C<'.&end'> to match.

Note that you may examine and alter the L<worklist|worklist> at this time.

=item .plain

This is a list ref that contains symbol names.  Before processing begins, everything on it is
added to the C<%EXPORT> definition as self-named symbols without versioning or aliases.  This
makes it easy to have something like the traditional C<@EXPORT> list, copying such a list when
upgrading to use C<Exporter::VA> without reformatting it, or just being more succinct.

For example, 

	%EXPORT= (
		'.plain' => [qw/foo $x &zed/],

will generate (recall that an empty string means "same name as the key")

	%EXPORT= (
		'&foo' => "",
		'$x' => "",
		'&zed' => "",

You can also list a C<:tag> name here, and this will expand to the tag names.  The tag must
be a list of names, not an alternating v-string/name list.

This is similar to the traditional C<Exporter::export_tags> and C<Exporter::export_ok_tags>, in
that it it prevents you from having to invidually list as exports all the items that are also in
the tag's definition list.

	%EXPORT= (
		'.plain' => [qw/:DEFAULT fozzle/],
		':DEFAULT' => [qw/foo bar baz/],
		bar => '_bar_internal'
		);

The above example will add plain export entries for C<foo> and C<baz> as well as
C<fozzle>, but silently ignore C<bar> as redundant since it is already listed as an export.


=item .&unknown_feature

	%EXPORT= (
		'.&unknown_feature' => sub {
		  my ($blessed_export_def, $caller, $version, $weird_parameter, $param_list_tail)= @_;
		  #...

Before generating an error for an C<import> parameter that is syntactically incorrect,
this callback will be tried.

If it returns, then the module assumes that this callback handled the whatever-it-was.  If the callback
cannot handle the parameter, it should fail by calling C<die>.

The callback can do its work by manipulating the object and the caller's namespace, and calling
the supplied implementation functions such as C<L<export>>.

For example,

	use ModuleName 1.0 qw/foo -prag +huh bar/;

will trigger C<.&unknown_feature> when the C<"+huh"> parameter is reached during processing.
You can use this to implement the classic C<Exporter>'s feature of having a leading C<!> remove
an import (see L<worklist|worklist>), for example.

=item .&unknown_import

	%EXPORT= (
		'.&unknown_import' => sub {
		  my ($blessed_export_def, $caller, $version, $symbol, $param_list_tail)= @_;
		  #...

This callback is invoked for an unlisted symbol.  It must return C<undef> to indicate no
error but no real export either (i.e. a pragmatic import) or a reference to the correct type 
of thing based on the name in C<$symbol>, or C<die> if the C<$symbol> could not be
handled.  The default implementation indicates an error for any symbol.

=item .&unknown_type

	%EXPORT= (
		'.&unknown_type' => sub {
		  my ($blessed_export_def, $caller, $version, $strange_import_param, $import_list_tail)= @_;
		  #...

If the import list contains something that is not a scalar, then it is passed to this callback.  The
thing in question is C<$strange_import_param>.

This is handy for implementing modules that take a hash ref or other object in addition to export
names.  This can also be done by making it follow a pragmatic import, or looking for it in a C<.&begin>
pass.

This callback must do whatever it needs to in your module.  It doesn't return anything to the export
engine (so C<die> to fail).  The callback may call C<< $self->export >> with more symbols, if it needs to do any
real exporting.

=item .verbose_import

If true, it will print trace statements as the specifications are being processed, and explain what is
actually being imported into modules.  If false, it stays mute except for warnings or errors.

When importing is complete and C<.verbose_import> is true, then C<.verbose_import> is decremented.  This
means that setting it to 1 will operate as a one-shot, only reporting details the I<first> time it is
C<use>d.  If you set it to 2, then two calls to this module's C<import> will be be reported, and so on.

If you don't define a C<--verbose_import> key in the C<%EXPORT> definition, then this module will 
automatically define a C<--verbose_import> pragmatic import that will activate verbose mode if used.

	use ModuleName 2.0 qw/ --verbose_import foo bar/;

Of course, it doesn't take effect until after that C<--verbose_import> parameter has been processed,
so it will not report setup and things to its left.

Any pragmas that refer to the import process itself rather than any resulting semantics of
the module will begin with a double-dash.

=item .warnings

If the value is true, then extra keys that are not known options are reported as warnings, and
other possible typos are reported in the C<%EXPORT> definition.  If false, then it doesn't go out
of its way to look for problems, speeding up the process.

The default value, if this option is not given, is 1.  You must specify

		.warnings => 0,

to I<disable> these warnings.

=item user-defined and reserved

To prevent typos, when I<warnings> are enabled, the C<%EXPORT> definition is scanned for
unknown options.

If you derive from or otherwise extend C<Exporter::VA> and wish to add more options, use
option names beginning with capital letters (or a C<&> followed by a capital letter).  All others are 
reserved for future versions of this module.

Also, supply a method C<check_user_option> in your derived class or use the C<.check_user_option> option
to declare your additional options.

=back

=head2 Quick guide to difference compared to classic Exporter

Also see the Exporter-VA-Convert.perl program, which will automatically read a module and tell you
exactly what to change and show you the equivilent C<%EXPORT> definition.

With classic Exporter,

	package SomeModule;
	require Exporter;
	@ISA = qw(Exporter);

becomes, with C<Exporter::VA>,

	package SomeModule;
	use Exporter::VA 1.1 ':normal';

The classic Exporter 

	@EXPORT_OK = qw/ foo bar /; # symbols to export on request

becomes with C<Exporter::VA>,

	%EXPORT= (
	   '.plain' => [ qw/ foo bar /];
	   # ...
	   };

The classic Exporter

	@EXPORT = qw/ baz quux /;  # symbols to export by default

becomes a tag named C<:DEFAULT>, thus:

	%EXPORT= (
	   '.plain' => [ qw/ :DEFAULT /];
	   ':DEFAULT' => [ qw/ foo bar / ];
	   };

and listing them as C<:DEFAULT> doesn't releive you from having define the individual
exports.  Using C<.plain> is the simplest way to define the exports, and note that you
don't have to re-list all of them, as it takes tag names too.

Likewise, any named tag is also listed as a key in the C<%EXPORT> list in this format.

=head2 Aliases and Non-Imported Calls

An alias specified in the C<%EXPORT> definition only works if it's imported.  For example,
if the C<%EXPORT> definition contained

	foo => [ v1.0, 'foo_old', v2.0, 'foo_new' ],
	bar => 'bar_internal',
	fobble => \&figure_it_out,

and the main program used:

	use ModuleName v1.5 qw(foo bar);

then the main code could call C<foo> and get C<ModuleName::foo_old>, and call C<bar> and
get C<ModuleName::bar_internal>.  But what happens if the main code explicitly calls
C<ModuleName::foo> or doesn't import at all, and tries to call C<ModuleName::fobble>?

It will indeed attempt to call functions named C<ModuleName::foo> and C<ModuleName::fobble>,
respectivly.  That is not the same as what happens when calling through the imported symbol.

To handle this, simply arrange it so there I<is> a function defined as C<ModuleName::foo> etc.

The best way to handle this is to assure that the directly-called functions have the identical semantics
as the imported aliases.

This can be handled automatically, by having C<ModuleName> import C<AUTOLOAD> from C<Exporter::VA>.
Then, a direct call to C<foo> will (if you don't happen to have an unrelated function called foo also!) land in
C<AUTOLOAD>, which will automatically generate a suitable C<ModuleName::foo>.  It will look up the
caller's desired version at run-time and jump to either C<foo_old> or C<foo_new> as appropreate.

If you need to write your own C<AUTOLOAD> for the module for other reasons, you can incorporate this
ability by calling the method L<autoload_symbol|autoload_symbol>.

If you don't like the automatically-generated thunk, you can easily create your own using the
underlying helper functions.  In order to write a function C<foo> that checks the caller's desired
version and calls the appropreate version, use the methods L<resolve|resolve> 
and L<client_desired_version|client_desired_version>.

There is no automatic facility to do this for non-functions.  You are better off using access methods instead
of direct access to data values.  But, you can accomplish much the same thing by using ties to a variable
of the stated name, where the tie's implementation switches between underlying versions.

If a data structure changes, instead of versioning the export for the data item, have the new version
remove the export of the data item and introduce an access method in its place.

=head2 Extending Exporter::VA

=head3 Using .&begin and .&end options

The easiest way to add some processing around this module's C<import> semantics is to use
the C<L<.&begin>> and L<C<.&end>> options.

=head3 Writing Your Own Import Function

It is simplest to import the implementation of C<import> from C<Exporter::VA>.
Anything you can do by wrapping it within a larger piece of code can be done using the C<L<.begin>> and C<L<.end>>
options.  You can also make changes by overriding various other methods in a derived class.  If you
do wish to write your own C<import> function, the generated one looks like this:

 	my $export_def; # found before function is generated
 	sub import 
 	 {
	 my $home= shift;
	 $export_def->setup ($home);  # happens first time used.
	 my $module= _calling_client();  # does caller() in a loop 'till out of Exporter::VA.
	 my $version= $export_def->get_import_version();
	 $export_def->set_client_desired_version ($module, $version);
	 $export_def->callback ('.&begin', $module, $version, '.&begin', \@_);
	 @_ = ':DEFAULT'  if (!@_ && defined $export_def->{':DEFAULT'});
	 $export_def ->export ($module, $version, \@_);
	 $export_def->callback ('.&end', $module, $version, '.&begin', \@_);
	 $export_def->_process_worklist();
	 }

See this module's own L<pragmas|pragmas> for information on customizing this generated code without
rewriting it or cutting and pasting it.

=head3 The VERSION function

When a module uses C<Exporter::VA>, it typically imports a generated C<VERSION> function.  This makes the
versioning capabilities work, as C<ModuleName::VERSION> will not simply verify that the requested
version is less than the module's version, but will record the per-client desired version number for
subsequent use.

If the module doesn't import the generated C<VERSION> function from C<Exporter::VA>, then the versioning
features will not be available, and version numbers specified in C<use> statements will be silently
ignored by C<Exporter::VA>, since it will never see it.

=head3 Inheriting from Exporter::VA

This module is fundimentally designed to allow custimization via deriving from it.  However, the way it is
used is unique, and making it behave as an object needs a little explaining.

The C<import> function called by C<use> does not contain a this/self parameter, but only has the
list of imports.  In order to have all its helper functions make virtual calls and thus allow replacement,
an object is introduced as soon as possible.

The object is simply the C<%EXPORT> definition.  As you can see from the listing of C<import> above,
A reference to the C<%EXPORT> definition is blessed into C<Exporter::VA>, and
all subsequent functions are dispatched through it.

If you derive from C<Exporter::VA>, you must bless the object into your derived package instead, and
then your function overrides will be used.

Since C<import> has no object, it has the package name hard-coded into it.  If you derive from C<Exporter::VA>,
you I<could> supply the definition of C<import> from your derived class as well.  But if that's the only change
you need, you can use this module's own C<-derived> L<pragma|pragmas>.  This is an example of using
a pragmatic import to paramiterize the generation of an imported function.

	package Extend;
	use Exporter::VA ();
	@ISA= ('Exporter::VA');
	sub resolve { ... # override what I need to change here

	package ModuleName;
	use Exporter::VA qw/ -derived Extend  import AUTOLOAD /;
	%EXPORT= { ... #
	# proceed writing my module

=head2 Methods

=head3 autoload_symbol

	autoload_symbol ($blessed_export_def, $module, $symbol)

Call this to implement C<AUTOLOAD>, or pre-generate the thunks.  Calling this will generate
a sub named C<$symbol> into C<$module> that will redirect to the proper function
based on its immediate caller at run-time.

=head3 check_user_option

	$errormessage= check_user_option ($blessed_export_def, $optionname)

Supply this function in a derived class if you are adding any user-defined options.  If
checking is enabled, then any hash keys in the C<%EXPORT> definition that begin with a
C<.> or C<.&> followed by a capital letter are passed to this function for validation.

Return C<undef> if the option is OK, and no warning will be emitted.  Return a string
and it will be incorporated into the warning message.

The built-in base implementation will call the code in C<L<.check_user_option>> if
present, or otherwise report a warning on all parameters it checks.

=head3 client_desired_version

	$vstring= client_desired_version ($blessed_export_def, $caller)

This returns a v-string stating which version was C<use>d by the specified C<$caller> package.

=head3 dump

	dump ($blessed_export_def)

This prints a debug dump of the object to the C<VERBOSE> handle.  This might be handy to
call from your callbacks (or pragmatic imports) to see what's going on.  This is called by the
C<--dump> pragma.

=head3 export

	export ($blessed_export_def, $caller, $version, $item_or_list)

This will export a single item or a list of items.  C<$item_or_list> can be a single item (as from
an import list) or a reference to a whole list.  Each item is processed using the full rules
of the C<%EXPORT> definition.

You can call this from pragmatic callbacks or other places to explicitly export something at will.

The specified item(s) are resolved and then placed into the C<$caller>'s package.

=head3 find_export_def ($caller, $import_list)

Not virtual, but regular function.

This is used by C<import> to locate the C<%EXPORT> definition.  If it is found in the
C<$import_list>, it is removed from the list.  If not found in the list, then it looks for
the package global C<%EXPORT> in the C<$caller>.  Either way, it returns the hash ref.

You only need to call this yourself if implementing your own C<import>.

=head3 resolve

	$ref= resolve ($blessed_export_def, $caller, $version, $item, $import_param_tail)

This will look for C<$item> based on the C<%EXPORT> definition, and return a reference to the 
thing to export under that name based on the specified C<$version> and possibly the C<$caller>.  
The C<$caller> and C<$import_param_tail> are not needed directly, but will be passed to callbacks.

=head3 set_client_desired_version ($blessed_export_def, $caller, $version)

This is the inverse of C<client_desired_version>.  You probably don't need to call this directly, since it
is handled by the module's C<VERSION> function and triggered through the C<use> statement.  You would
call this from C<VERSION> if implementing it directly.

=head3 worklist

	$hashref= worklist ($blessed_export_def)

This return a reference to the I<work list>, used during the import list processing.

As each item in the import list is processed, the result doesn't get placed immediatly into
the caller's namespace.  Rather, it is added to this work list in the form C<< symbolname => ref >>.
This allows for subsequent pragmatic options or C<.&end> or future features to modify the list
before the work it represents is comitted.

TODO: decide how to keep the list ordered.

=head2 Exports

=head3 special

If a parameter to C<Exporter::VA>'s own C<import> is not a string but a hash ref, then it is
taken as the argument to the C<-def> pragma.

The package global file handle C<Exporter::VA::VERBOSE> is used for verbose-mode output
messages.  It is initially aliased to C<STDERR>, but may be redirected using glob assignment.

=head3 functions

import, AUTOLOAD, VERSION

=head3 tags

The tag C<:normal> will import the normal 3 functions, C<import>, C<AUTOLOAD>, and C<VERSION>.
This is not the C<:DEFAULT> on a matter of principle, that module writers are encouraged not to
export things by default and it is ironic to violate this in the exporter itself.

=head3 pragmas

=over 4

=item -def I<hashref>

This will supply the C<%EXPORT> definition, as opposed to having it found as a package global in
the caller.  You can leave off the C<-def> actually, and simply provide a hash ref argument
to import (via the C<use> statement).  The named pragma is provided for completeness sake.

	use ModuleName 0.2 (
		-def => \%myhash,
		qw/foo bar/
		);

As a special rule, this parameter may be located anywhere in the import list; it does not have
to come first, even though parameters are normally processed left-to-right.  This module goes
out of its way to do this because it is nicer to write it last, in producing readable code.

	use Exporter::VA ('import', 'VERSION', {
		foo => \\&internal_foo,
		bar => \\&internal_bar,
		# long list
		} );

You have the option of putting the regular parameters first, so they are not lost at the end of
the long literal hash.

=item -derived I<name>

The pragmatic import C<< -derived I<name> >> will customize the generated import function to contain
the specified I<name> as the package to bless the object into.  This is handy for deriving from C<Exporter::VA>.
For example:

	package ModuleName;
	use Exporter::VA qw/-derived ExpEnhancement import AUTOLOAD/;

note that this only affects items farther to the right in the list, so it makes sense to always put
C<-derived> first.

=item --dump

This will display the state of the C<%EXPORT> definition hash to the C<VERBOSE> file handle.  This
will include the items specified by the module doing the exporting, defaults expanded or filled in, and
internal state values.

=item --verbose_import

See L<.verbose|the .verbose setting>.  This increments the C<.verbose> value.

=head1 Compatibility

=head2 Platforms

Developed originally on Perl 5.6.1, ActiveState build 630 for Windows.  It uses only pure Perl and no
non-basic modules, so it ought to work on any platform.  It uses nothing that should be changed in
Perl 5.8.

I'd appreciate it if anyone using a different configuration (not listed below) let me know that the test1.perl
script works properly and that there are no issues.  If there are issues, I'm even more interested!

	Tested on:
	Exporter::VA version 1.1 on Perl 5.6.1 (AS 630, Windows 2000)
	... others wanted!

=head2 Unicode / utf8

In Perl 5.6, a compiled regex only works properly with strings of the same discipline (byte-oriented or
character oriented).  So, how should this module be compiled, with or without Unicode
regex's?  Since the strings being matched will be Perl identifier names, and non-ASCII identifiers
are only allowed when C<use utf8> is in effect, that is the natural choice.  Without utf8 mode, you
have no business importing a symbol that contains a Unicode name, anyway.  Note that if you do pass
byte-oriented strings to the C<import()> function that contain values >127, you'll get warnings about
bad UTF-8 encoding from the module.  Don't do that.  You have no business using such characters in
identifier names, and you'll have to work-around that for pragmatic import names beginning with a
dash (which don't have to be legal identifiers).  The regex issue is fixed in Perl 5.8, so it is no longer
a problem moving forward.

=head2 Threads

The Exporter::VA module is oblivious to threads.  Modules are normally imported at the beginning
of execution before threads are started, so there is not much incentive to verify the matter.  But if
you do call C<import()> for the same module from two different threads, the C<%EXPORT> definition
should be copied to each thread.  As of writing, I'm unaware of how symbol tables are shared (or not).
Anyone who explores the matter or stresses the module in this regard, please let me know.

=head1 Caveats and known issues

The version-number handling is still primitive.  You must use a v-string (not a float) for the
indirect object to C<use> (just don't leave out the sometimes-optional leading C<v>), and 
the C<$VERSION> package global must be a v-string, not an ASCII-string.  That is, C<our $VERSION= v1.0.2;> works,
C<our $VERSION= "1.0.2";> does not (yet).  Versions are compared without normalizing, so
v1.2.3.0 will compare greater than (not equal to) v.1.2.3.  This will be fixed soon.

Warning on directly importing something that begins with an underscore - probably not
implemented.  Not unit testing the presence of documented warnings, anyway.

.allowed_VERSIONS option not implemented.

.check_user_option option not implemented

.verbose_import not yet "one-shot".

.warings not implemented.

AUTOLOAD thunks and autoload_import for versioned imports not implemented yet.

client_desired_version() public method not implemented yet.

-derived pragma not implemented yet.

=head1 HISTORY

October 2002 - preliminary documentation and design reviews

December 3, 2002 - Basic export works (see test1.perl).  Made available for peer review of code.

v1.0 on December 10, 2002 -
Stable and fairly clean, with unit tests.  Supports everything except version lists.

December 19, 2002 - v1.1 - redid the way VERSION works.
Bug fix: the tag list definition was being eaten.  Exporting the same module again would see it empty!
version-list in export def (but not in tag list) works.

December 22, 2002 - work on VERSION function and docs, version checking, version support routines.
Implement version-list in tag list.

December 23, 2002 - review docs, produce 'issues' list, make install.perl.

v1.2 released.  Supports everything except non-imported alias suite of features.

January 6, 2003 - Exporter-VA-Convert.perl utility, release procedure.

January 9, 2003 - 
	if .default_VERSION left out, assumes current $VERSION.
	installer runs unit tests, rolls back on failure.
	test1.perl has --quiet mode.
	put in more unit testing code.

v1.2.2 released.
